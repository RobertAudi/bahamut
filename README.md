## Songs

*For those of us who are tired of iTunes's crap*

* Current version: **0.1**
* Requires: OS X 10.8 and up
* Download: coming soon

#### What's left for 1.0

- Window title should show selected playlist
- Steal Sparkle and the auto-build stuff from Zephyros
- Keyboard shortcuts for *everything*
- Optional Menu bar interface (TunesBar port)
- Fix all the playlist- and song-selection bugs
    - When you filter a playlist, the selection doesn't follow the songs
    - When you add/remove a song, the selection doesn't follow the songs
    - When you add/remove a playlist, the selection doesn't follow the playlist
- Make the track-bar not jump after you finish dragging it
- Find (or draw?) a "pause" icon for the playlist/song currently-playing rows
- Delete songs from All Songs (and remove from every playlist)
    - This should be undo-able!
- Make "create playlist" button prettier somehow
- Figure out how to get Track info field to display "..." without tightening at every resize
- Only display track info parts that exist! ("album" sometimes doesn't, I think)
- Make it not take 500MB of memory just because you filtered all the songs.

#### To do after 1.0

- Figure out what exactly should happen when you change anything about playlist while it's playing
- Make it scriptable maybe?
